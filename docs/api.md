# 1. API Documentation

## 1.1. Example API Error Format

All of the `/api` routes use the following format to return errors:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid board id provided"
}
```

## 1.2. GET /

This route is used to render the template which renders the assets so that React can take over and render our boards index.

## 1.3. GET /boards/:id

This route is also used to render the template. If we don’t have this route, users will not be able to navigate directly to boards. They would need to access `/` and then click on a board, every time.

## 1.4. GET /cards/:id

Same as `GET /boards/:id`.

## 1.5. GET /ui

This page lists the static ui designs which should be used to build the React components.

## 1.6. GET /api/boards

Get all boards from the database. This does not return any nested data.

### 1.6.1. Controller#Action

`api/boards#index`

### 1.6.2. Expected parameters

None

### 1.6.3. Example Response

```json
[
